  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p><strong>Mid-South Truck & Trailer Service</strong> is Northeast Arkansas’s trusted team for keeping trucks and trailers road-ready, rain or shine. Founded by people who know what it’s like to keep a fleet running, we pride ourselves on old-school service with new-school tech.</p>
  <p>We’re local, family-owned, and we treat every rig like our own—because we’ve been there ourselves. Our customers include major fleets, independent operators, and everyone in between.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decades of combined experience</li>
    <li>Licensed, insured, and DOT-compliant</li>
    <li>Flexible scheduling and emergency callouts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>From routine washouts to “get me rolling at 2 AM” repairs, we’re the ones other shops call when it matters.</p>
